Probes have common settings:

initialDelaySeconds: how many seconds should pass before probes should be active
periodSeconds: the probing frequency
timeoutSeconds: the number of seconds after which the probe times out
successThreshold: how many times should the probe succeed before the container should be seen as healthy
failureThreshold: how many times should the probe fail before the container should be seen as failing
